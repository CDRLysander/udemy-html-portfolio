<h1>The best movies according to Lysandros</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Schindler's List</h3>
<p>Perhaps the top movie displaying the abject horror of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.</p>

<h3>Lincoln</h3>
<p>The best movie adaptation of the life of the most consequential U.S. President.</p>

<h3>Come and See</h3>
<p>Similar to Schindler's List, but from the Soviet cinematographic perspective.</p>
